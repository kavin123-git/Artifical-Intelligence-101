# AI 101 Projects – IIT Kanpur

This repository contains two core projects developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence: 101** course conducted by the Electrical Engineering Association, IIT Kanpur (Dec ’24 – Feb ’25). These projects focus on foundational applications of machine learning and deep learning in image classification and feature compression.

## 📁 Contents

### 1. Image Classification with PCA and SVM
**File:** `classifier_ai101_ass7.ipynb`  
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Supervised classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Visualizes eigenfaces and evaluates classifier performance on compressed feature sets.

### 2. Autoencoder for Feature Compression and Reconstruction
**File:** `autoencoder_ai101_ass7.ipynb`  
- Implemented a convolutional autoencoder using Keras.
- Performs unsupervised learning for image compression and reconstruction.
- Analyzes latent space and visualizes reconstruction quality.
